# Alternative TCM Frontend

## What is this?

This is a web application that provides an alternative, searchable frontend for movies on [TCM](https://www.tcm.com) (Turner Classic Movies).

## How do I use it?

I used to host this on my GitHub Pages site, but I've since taken it down as part of a redesign. You can clone this repository and run `npm install && npm run dev` if you want to try it out.

## Why did you make this?

I find TCM's search function kind of cumbersome. You can't filter on more than one genre or by release year, and clicking on a movie takes you to a new webpage. I would rather just see a filterable, sortable list of what is available, which is what this page does.

## Why isn't there an option to filter by such-and-such?

Go ahead and open an issue! I plan on adding lots more options to this program in case anyone finds them useful.
